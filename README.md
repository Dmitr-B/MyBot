# Telegram game bot(Stone, Scissors, Paper)
Bot implemented by scratch on **java**. During the development process, I actively used and studied the **Spring Framework**. 
The bot allows you to play the game of stone, scissors, paper, with which we are all so familiar from childhood:blush:
## How to play
Before the start, the bot is welcomed and tells about itself

After entering the command: **/start**, the bot offers to play the game. After that, you need to choose the option you want or choose random
